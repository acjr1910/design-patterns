In the Exercises project, look at the code in the TextDocument class.

This class represents a document in a word processor like MS Word or Apple Pages.
Our Document class has three attributes: 
-content
-fontName
-fontSize

We should allow the user to undo the changes to any of these attributes. In the future, we may add additional attributes in this class and these attributes should also be undoable.  Implement the undo feature using the memento pattern.
